# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

Spots is a responsive web page that showcases user-submitted photo cards with titles and like buttons. It adapts seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports using media queries, CSS Grid/Flexbox, and BEM methodology. The design strictly follows a Figma prototype, ensuring pixel-perfect layout and accessibility.

### Tech Stack

HTML – Semantic structure based on accessibility best practices
CSS – Responsive styling with Flexbox, Grid, and media queries
BEM Methodology – For consistent and maintainable class naming
Figma – Used as the design reference for layout and styling
Git & GitHub – Version control and deployment (via GitHub Pages)

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project--Spots?node-id=2-139&t=mYv1jJqEuGyJXAmJ-0)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
